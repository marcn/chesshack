CHESS HACK
==========

Fall 2013 Panda Hack-a-thon Project

In this project, it was our goal to create a completely autonomous chess computer running solely on Raspberry Pi, which uses a camera to perform computer vision to detect when pieces move on the board, and how they move.

The chess engine is the open source Stockfish 4, set to maximum difficulty which should beat grandmaster players even on the Raspberry Pi hardware!
